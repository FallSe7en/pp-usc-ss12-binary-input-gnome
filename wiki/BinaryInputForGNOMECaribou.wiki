#summary General information of the project

= Abstract =

[http://live.gnome.org/Caribou Caribou] is a text entry and UI navigation application being developed as an alternative to the Gnome On-screen Keyboard. The overarching goal for Caribou is to create a usable solution for people whose primary way of accessing a computer is a switch device.  Our goal for this project in this competition is to allow a user to use a binary input, such as a button, to interface with Caribou rather than with a mouse.

It accomplishes this by mimicking a sort of morse code
