#summary General information of the project

= Abstract =

Caribou is a text entry and UI navigation application being developed as an alternative to the Gnome On-screen Keyboard. The overarching goal for Caribou is to create a usable solution for people whose primary way of accessing a computer is a switch device.  Our goal for this project is to allow a user to use a binary input, such as a button, to interface with Caribou rather than with a mouse.
